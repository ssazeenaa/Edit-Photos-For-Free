    <h4>Sharing Your Content and Information</h4>

    <p>You own all of the content and information you post on EditPhotosForFree, and you can choose whether or not to make any EditPhotosForFree picture public by submitting it to the public EditPhotosForFree gallery when you save your image.</p>

    <p>When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).</p>

    <p>When you publish a EditPhotosForFree image and make it “public”, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of EditPhotosForFree.com, to view that image, and to associate it with your EditPhotosForFree username and/or your linked Facebook profile.</p>

Even if you have not allowed this application access, it may collect Information We Receive From Facebook about you when friends on Facebook allow access to and use the application, subject to your Facebook settings. We use this information to operate the application, such as posting to your wall or sharing with other users. As such, you must follow and comply with all of Facebooks policies and rules.</p>
